Dogs of Zürich
---
#### Two web-based visualisations of publicly available data.

One challenge was how to make something interactive and fun out of what is a .csv file 
I chose this dataset as I wanted to do something different, and avoid data showing correlation or a change over time. 
It soon became apparent to me that maybe the physical details and name of every dog in Zurich (years 2015-2023) didn’t actually have very much to say in the way of a story. It was a challenge to try and make something interactive and fun out of this dataset. 


  
Dataset is available at [Open Data Zurich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/).
